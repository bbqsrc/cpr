## What is cpr?

`cpr` is a tool that parses C headers to generates Rust FFI bindings (typically
called `-sys` crates).

It is currently in early stages, but a lot of ground has been covered already.

## Prior art

`bindgen` generates Rust FFI bindings using `clang`, LLVM's C frontend. By
leveraging an existing compiler framework, `bindgen` is able to focus on Rust
code generation.

There are some downsides to that approach as well: a (rather large) LLVM
distribution must be installed to build `bindgen` and generate bindings. Its
focus on `clang` makes it less ideal when used on Windows headers, for example.

## Our approach

`cpr` comes with its own C lexer, C preprocessor (including full macro
expansion capabilities), and C parser.

One of the core ideas behind `cpr` (besides support MSVC idiosyncracies) is
to allow *discovering defines* and their effects on the generated bindings.

Whereas a traditional C preprocessor would expand the following code:

```c
#ifdef UTF16
#define STR uint16_t*
#else
#define STR char*
#endif

STR get_string(void);
```

...to either:

```c
uint16_t* get_string(void);
```

...or:

```c
char* get_string(void);
```

...a generated bindings could contain both:

```rust
mod with_utf16 {
    extern "C" {
        pub fn get_string() -> *mut u16;
    }
}
#[cfg(utf16)]
pub use with_utf16::*;

mod without_utf16 {
    extern "C" {
        pub fn get_string() -> *mut u8;
    }
}
#[cfg(not(utf16))]
pub use without_utf16::*;
```

## Timeline

### lang-c fork

The first part of this project was to get Windows headers to parse at all.
The `lang-c` crate was forked, and MSVC extensions were added to it.

At that stage, C headers were preprocessed minimally (through a mix of
PEG parsers and regular expressions), just enough to be parsed with `lang-c`.

This effort was enough to verify that C code could be parsed leveraging
mostly existing Rust crates.

### Rust code generation

Shortly after, work began on code translation. The C AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
is not trivially translatable to Rust, as, for example, the following C code:

```rust
typedef struct S {
    int a;
    int b;
} S;
```

...defines two types, `struct S` and `S`. The translation process not being
feasible as a straight-forward tree walk, an intermediate representation was
devised (see the `rg` module).

The workflow then became:

```
[ C code ] -> [ C AST ] -> [ rg nodes ] -> [ Rust code ]
```

### Generating bindings for multiple code paths

In parallel, proper preprocessing of line continuations and comments was
implemented (using state machines), so that:

```c
int \
  a = /* comment */ 24;
```

Becomes:

```c
int a = 24;
```

This pre-processing step supports single-line and multi-line comments and is
compliant with the C99 standard, to the best of our knowledge.

After basic code generation started working, more attention was paid to the
idea of defines being not just "undefined" or "defined", but sometimes
"unknown".

Additional work on this angle quickly revealed edge cases (encountered in real-life
Windows SDK headers)

```c
struct s {
    int foo;
#ifdef BAR
    int bar;
#endif
};
```

A naive approach to multi-path processing would fail, as the `struct s { int
foo; ` lines alone do not form a complete C declaration.

However, research has shown that none of these edge cases are unsurmountable.

The basic idea is to keep aggregating lines together until they form one (or more) complete
C declarations, effectively transforming the above example to:

```c
#if defined(BAR)
struct s {
    int foo;
    int bar;
};
#endif

#if !defined(BAR)
struct s {
    int foo;
}
#endif
```

...which can be (relatively) easily translated to feature-gated Rust code.

We'll refer to this process as "chunking".

In order to achieve that, regions of the original C source were annotated
with "constant expressions", to be used later when generating Rust code with
`#[cfg]` attributes.

Chunking sometimes resulted in complex expressions, especially with nested `#if`
or `#if`-`#elseif` chains. Consequently, multiple simplification algorithms were
attempted.

In the end, we chose Quine McCluskey's algorithm to simplify boolean
expressions, as implemented by @oli_obk. C constant expressions are
translated into a format suitable for Q-MC, simplified, and transformed back.

### Complex define expressions and macro expansion

The multi-path approach outlined above, while promising, proved difficult to adapt
to real-life header files in their entirety.

To take a practical example, parsing `projectedfslib.h`, the [Windows
Projected File System API][projfs], depends on 75 (seventy-five) additional
header files.

[projfs]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/projfs/projected-file-system

It cannot be parsed in isolation, as it uses types defined in other headers such as
`minwindef.h`, `winnt.h`, etc.

Its preprocessor conditions (`#ifdef`, `#if`, etc.) are often more complex than Cargo
feature flags would allow, such as:

```c
#if (_WIN32_WINNT >= _WIN32_WINNT_WIN10_RS5)
```

Or:

```c
#if WINAPI_FAMILY_PARTITION(WINAPI_PARTITION_APP | WINAPI_PARTITION_SYSTEM)
```

Additionally, `#define` directives are only rarely flag toggles - they're used
for anything ranging from actual "code generation":

```c
DEFINE_ENUM_FLAG_OPERATORS(PRJ_NOTIFY_TYPES);
```

to function aliases:

```c
#ifdef UNICODE
#define DeleteFile  DeleteFileW
#else
#define DeleteFile  DeleteFileA
#endif // !UNICODE
```

The decision was taken to first bring `cpr`'s preprocessing capabilities up
to par with a traditional C compiler.

A full lexer and macro expansion algorithm were
implemented, taking into account the particularities of MSVC and Windows SDK
headers.

The result is a pure Rust codebase that is able to:

  * Process line continuations and strip C comments
  * Parse and process C directives such as `#include`, `#define`, `#if`, `#elseif`, etc.
  * Lex lines of C code (into token sequences)
  * Expand those token sequences, substituting macro calls, performing token
  pasting, stringizing, etc. in a standard-compliant way
  * Parse those lines as C code, aggregating them if declarations span multiple lines

The current `cpr` codebase can preprocess and parse the following header:

```c
#define _AMD64_
#define _M_AMD64
#define _WIN32

#include <minwindef.h>
#include <winnt.h>
#include <projectedfslib.h>
```

...resulting in a series of C external declarations for each header file,
ready for translation into Rust.

### Future work

The obvious next step for `cpr` is to connect the new parser to the existing
Rust translator, and add support for more constructs, such as packed structs,
unions, and bitfields.

This should bring `cpr` to a point where it can generate usable `-sys` crates
for arbitrary Win32 APIs.

The step after that would be to re-introduce "unknown" defines (multi-path
binding generation), and to augment `cpr`'s preprocessor so that contextual
information can be generated for C code.

Such insight could be used to answer questions like:

  * What set of `#define`s influence the definition of this particular function?

Those defines could, in turn, be either "defined", to enable disabled-by-default
parts of APIs, or "set as unknown" to generate all variants.

This case-by-case approach to multi-path generation seems much more likely to
succeed and avoid combinatorial explosion seen in the first attempt.

Even in the case where handling alternative expansions (for unknown `#define`s)
proves impractical, `cpr` still gathers enough knowledge for header files that
it should be able to assist the user (the person using it to generate bindings)
in picking a reasonable set of defines for their use case.
