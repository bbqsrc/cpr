# cpr report - April 15th, 2020

## What works?

Generating usable bindings for `fileapi.h` and `projectedfslib.h` at least -
which pull in the likes of `minwindef.h` and `winnt.h` (the big one).

## How to use

```
cargo b --release
./target/release/cpr ./samples/projectedfslib/root.h --output ./out/projectedfslib
```

cpr will parse `root.h` and all the headers it includes. For example, to
generate bindings for `fileapi.h`, `root.h` should read as follows:

```c
#include <minwindef.h>
#include <fileapi.h>

// note: `cpr` has preset defines like `_AMD64_` and `_M_AMD64`, depending on
// the `--arch` parameter, which defaults to `x86-64`.
```

For a working demo, see the `samples/demo` crate (not part of the workspace),
which uses a set of bindings generated from 

The output path is a folder that contains a generated crate. Its name is
always `bindings` for now. The `Cargo.toml` manifest is auto-generated, and
one `src/*.rs` file is generated for each `.h` file that has declarations.

Windows SDKs and MSVC paths are auto-detected on Windows. On other platforms,
they can be specified with `--kits-path` and `--msvc-path`.

## Limitations

Everything is in a single namespace - `src/lib.rs` has every module as `pub`
and `pub uses` every symbol exported by the module. This will be addressed
later.

Constants are best-effort, for example:

```c
#define FOO 0xF
```

Will result in:

```rust
const FOO: u32 = 15;
```

(That it doesn't maintain hexadecimal notation is a bug that will be
addressed later)

Unions are ignored for now.
